#  Solving the One-Way Wave Equation
<p>For values of x in the interval [−1, 3] and t in [0, 2.4], solve the one-way wave equation  u_t + u_x = 0, with the initial data u(0, x) = 􏰀cos2(πx) if |x| ≤ 21, u(0, x) = 0 otherwise; and the boundary data u(t, −1) = 0.
Define λ = k/h. Use the following four methods for h = 1/10, 1/20 and 1/40.
<li>(a) Forward-time central-space scheme with λ = 0.8; </li>
<li>(b) Leapfrog scheme with λ = 0.8; </li>
<li>(c) Upwind scheme with λ = 0.8;</li>
<li>(d) Lax-Friedrichs scheme with λ = 0.8.</li>
